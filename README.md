# Frequency Division Multiplexing Using NumPy
# 🔍 Aim

To implement Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) using Python and NumPy by generating message signals, modulating them onto different carrier frequencies, combining them into a multiplexed FDM signal, and analyzing the spectrum using FFT.

# 🛠️ Software Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

# 📘 Theory

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a method in which multiple signals share a common transmission medium by placing each signal on a different carrier frequency, avoiding overlap in the frequency domain.

Each message signal is modulated using DSB-SC:

Using unique carrier frequencies ensures each signal occupies a separate frequency band.

# 🧮 Algorithm

Import NumPy and Matplotlib

Define sampling frequency and time axis

Generate message signals

Choose well-spaced carrier frequencies

Modulate each message using DSB-SC

Add the modulated signals → FDM composite

Perform FFT on FDM signal
